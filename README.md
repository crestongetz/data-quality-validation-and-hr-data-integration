# data-quality-validation-and-hr-data-integration

## Overview
This project focuses on the `high-stakes data challenges of a company merger`. The `goal` was to `validate` and `integrate` a messy employee dataset from a newly acquired firm into a parent company’s database while maintaining compliance and `data integrity/quality`.

Using Python (Pandas), I identified and resolved critical anomalies—including extreme age outliers (e.g., 136 years old) and negative employment durations—that would have otherwise skewed corporate reporting and benefits eligibility. The final pipeline successfully merged 93 validated records, ensuring a consistent, single source of truth for the integrated organization.
